# Nightly Channel

> Nitro has a nightly release channel that automatically releases for every commit to `main` branch to try latest changes.

You can opt-in to the nightly release channel by updating your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "nitro": "npm:nitro-nightly@latest"
  }
}
```

Remove the lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lock`, or `bun.lockb`) and reinstall the dependencies.



::important
When using **Bun as package manager** in a mono-repo, you need to make sure nitro package is properly hoisted.

<br>

```toml [bunfig.toml]
[install]
publicHoistPattern = ["nitro*"]
```

::


::important
Avoid using `<npm|pnpm|yarn|bun|deno> install nitro-nightly`; it does not install correctly.
If you encounter issues, delete your `node_modules` and lock files, then follow the steps above.
