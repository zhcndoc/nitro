# Routing

> Nitro supports filesystem routing to automatically map files to routes. By combining code-splitting with compiled routes, it removes the need for a runtime router, leaving only minimal compiled logic.

::warning
Nitro v3 Alpha docs are a work in progress — expect updates, rough edges, and occasional inaccuracies.
::

## Request handler

Nitro request handler is a function accepting an `event` object, which is a [H3Event](https://h3.dev/guide/api/h3event#h3event-properties) object.

::code-group
```ts [Single function]
import type { H3Event } from "nitro/h3";

export default (event: H3Event) => {
  return "world";
}
```
```ts [defineHandler]
import { defineHandler } from "nitro/h3";

// For better type inference
export default defineHandler((event) => {
  return "world";
});
```
::

## Filesystem routing

Nitro supports file-based routing for your API routes (files are automatically mapped to [h3 routes](https://h3.dev/guide/basics/routing)). Defining a route is as simple as creating a file inside the `api/` or `routes/` directory.

You can only define one handler per files and you can [append the HTTP method](#specific-request-method) to the filename to define a specific request method.

```
routes/
  api/
    test.ts      <-- /api/test
  hello.get.ts   <-- /hello (GET only)
  hello.post.ts  <-- /hello (POST only)
vite.config.ts
```

You can nest routes by creating subdirectories.

```txt
routes/
  api/
    [org]/
      [repo]/
        index.ts   <-- /api/:org/:repo
        issues.ts  <-- /api/:org/:repo/issues
      index.ts     <-- /api/:org
package.json
```

#### Route Groups

In some cases, you may want to group a set of routes together in a way which doesn't affect file-based routing. For this purpose, you can put files in a folder which is wrapped in parentheses `(` and `)`.

For example:
```txt
routes/
  api/
    (admin)/
      users.ts   <-- /api/users
      reports.ts <-- /api/reports
    (public)/
      index.ts   <-- /api
package.json
```
> [!NOTE] The route groups are not part of the route definition and are only used for organization purposes.


### Static routes

First, create a file in `routes/` or `routes/api/` directory. The filename will be the route path.

Then, export a fetch-compatible function:

```ts [routes/api/test.ts]
import { defineHandler } from "nitro/h3";

export default defineHandler(() => {
  return { hello: "API" };
});
```

### Dynamic routes

#### Single param

To define a route with params, use the `[<param>]` syntax where `<param>` is the name of the param. The param will be available in the `event.context.params` object or using the [`getRouterParam`](https://h3.dev/utils/request#getrouterparamevent-name-opts-decode) utility.

```ts [routes/hello/[name\\].ts]
import { defineHandler } from "nitro/h3";

export default defineHandler((event) => {
  const { name } = event.context.params;

  return `Hello ${name}!`;
});
```

Call the route with the param `/hello/nitro`, you will get:

```txt [Response]
Hello nitro!
```

#### Multiple params

You can define multiple params in a route using `[<param1>]/[<param2>]` syntax where each param is a folder. You **cannot** define multiple params in a single filename of folder.

```ts [routes/hello/[name\\]/[age\\].ts]
import { defineHandler } from "nitro/h3";

export default defineHandler((event) => {
  const { name, age } = event.context.params;

  return `Hello ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`;
});
```

#### Catch-all params

You can capture all the remaining parts of a URL using `[...<param>]` syntax. This will include the `/` in the param.

```ts [routes/hello/[...name\\].ts]
import { defineHandler } from "nitro/h3";

export default defineHandler((event) => {
  const { name } = event.context.params;

  return `Hello ${name}!`;
});
```

Call the route with the param `/hello/nitro/is/hot`, you will get:

```txt [Response]
Hello nitro/is/hot!
```

### Specific request method

You can append the HTTP method to the filename to force the route to be matched only for a specific HTTP request method, for example `hello.get.ts` will only match for `GET` requests. You can use any HTTP method you want.

::code-group
```js [GET]
// routes/users/[id].get.ts
import { defineHandler } from "nitro/h3";

export default defineHandler(async (event) => {
  const { id } = event.context.params;

  // Do something with id

  return `User profile!`;
});
```

```js [POST]
// routes/users.post.ts
import { defineHandler, readBody } from "nitro/h3";

export default defineHandler(async (event) => {
  const body = await readBody(event);

  // Do something with body like saving it to a database

  return { updated: true };
});
```
::

### Catch-all route

You can create a special route that will match all routes that are not matched by any other route. This is useful for creating a default route.

To create a catch-all route, create a file named `[...].ts`.

```ts [routes/[...\\].ts]
import { defineHandler } from "nitro/h3";

export default defineHandler((event) => {
  return `Hello ${event.url}!`;
});
```

### Environment specific handlers

You can specify for a route that will only be included in specific builds by adding a `.dev`, `.prod` or `.prerender` suffix to the file name, for example: `routes/test.get.dev.ts` or `routes/test.get.prod.ts`.

> [!TIP]
> You can specify multiple environments or specify a preset name as environment using programmatic registration of routes via `handlers[]` config.

## Middleware

Nitro route middleware can hook into the request lifecycle.

::tip
A middleware can modify the request before it is processed, not after.
::

Middleware are auto-registered within the `middleware/` directory.

```md
middleware/
  auth.ts
  logger.ts
  ...
routes/
  hello.ts
```

### Simple middleware

Middleware are defined exactly like route handlers with the only exception that they should not return anything.
Returning from middleware behaves like returning from a request - the value will be returned as a response and further code will not be ran.

```ts [middleware/auth.ts]
import { defineHandler } from "nitro/h3";

export default defineHandler((event) => {
  // Extends or modify the event
  event.context.user = { name: "Nitro" };
});
```

Middleware in `middleware/` directory are automatically registered for all routes. If you want to register a middleware for a specific route, see [Object Syntax Event Handler](https://h3.dev/guide/basics/handler#object-syntax).

::note
Returning anything from a middleware will close the request and should be avoided! Any returned value from middleware will be the response and further code will not be executed however **this is not recommended to do!**
::

### Route Meta

You can define route handler meta at build-time using `defineRouteMeta` macro in the event handler files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 🚧 This feature is currently experimental.

```ts [routes/api/test.ts]
import { defineRouteMeta } from "nitro";
import { defineHandler } from "nitro/h3";

defineRouteMeta({
  openAPI: {
    tags: ["test"],
    description: "Test route description",
    parameters: [{ in: "query", name: "test", required: true }],
  },
});

export default defineHandler(() => "OK");
```

::read-more{to="https://swagger.io/specification/v3/"}
This feature is currently usable to specify OpenAPI meta. See swagger specification for available OpenAPI options.
::

### Execution order

Middleware are executed in directory listing order.

```md
middleware/
  auth.ts <-- First
  logger.ts <-- Second
  ... <-- Third
```

Prefix middleware with a number to control their execution order.

```md
middleware/
  1.logger.ts <-- First
  2.auth.ts <-- Second
  3.... <-- Third
```
::note
Remember that file names are sorted as strings, thus for example if you have 3 files `1.filename.ts`, `2.filename.ts` and `10.filename.ts`, the `10.filename.ts` will come after the `1.filename.ts`. To avoid this, prefix `1-9` with a `0` like `01`, if you have more than 10 middleware in the same directory.
::

### Request filtering

Middleware are executed on every request.

Apply custom logic to scope them to specific conditions.

For example, you can use the URL to apply a middleware to a specific route:

```ts [middleware/auth.ts]
import { defineHandler } from "nitro/h3";

export default defineHandler((event) => {
  // Will only execute for /auth route
  if (event.url.pathname.startsWith('/auth')) {
    event.context.user = { name: "Nitro" };
  }
});
```

## Error handling

You can use the [utilities available in H3](https://h3.dev/guide/basics/error) to handle errors in both routes and middlewares.

The way errors are sent back to the client depends on the environment. In development, requests with an `Accept` header of `text/html` (such as browsers) will receive a HTML error page. In production, errors are always sent in JSON.  

This behaviour can be overridden by some request properties (e.g.: `Accept` or `User-Agent` headers).

## Code splitting

Nitro creates a separate chunk for each route handler. Chunks load on-demand when first requested, so `/api/users` doesn't load code for `/api/posts`.

See [`inlineDynamicImports`](/config#inlinedynamicimports) to bundle everything into a single file.

## Route rules

Nitro allows you to add logic at the top-level for each route of your configuration. It can be used for redirecting, proxying, caching and adding headers to routes.

It is a map from route pattern (following [rou3](https://github.com/h3js/rou3)) to route options.

When `cache` option is set, handlers matching pattern will be automatically wrapped with `defineCachedEventHandler`. See the [cache guide](/docs/cache) to learn more about this function.

::note
`swr: true|number` is shortcut for `cache: { swr: true, maxAge: number }`
::

You can set route rules in the `nitro.routeRules` options.

```ts [nitro.config.ts]
import { defineNitroConfig } from "nitro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/blog/**': { swr: true },
    '/blog/**': { swr: 600 },
    '/blog/**': { static: true },
    '/blog/**': { cache: { /* cache options*/ } },
    '/assets/**': { headers: { 'cache-control': 's-maxage=0' } },
    '/api/v1/**': { cors: true, headers: { 'access-control-allow-methods': 'GET' } },
    '/old-page': { redirect: '/new-page' },
    '/old-page/**': { redirect: '/new-page/**' },
    '/proxy/example': { proxy: 'https://example.com' },
    '/proxy/**': { proxy: '/api/**' },
  }
});
```
