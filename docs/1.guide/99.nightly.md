# Nightly Channel

> Nitro has a nightly release channel that automatically releases for every commit to `main` branch to try latest changes.

You can opt-in to the nightly release channel by updating your `package.json`:

::code-group
```diff [Nitro]
{
  "devDependencies": {
--    "nitropack": "^2.0.0"
++    "nitropack": "npm:nitropack-nightly@latest"
  }
}
```
```diff [Nuxt]
{
  "devDependencies": {
--    "nuxt": "^3.0.0"
++    "nuxt": "npm:nuxt-nightly@latest"
  }
}
```
::

::note
If you are using Nuxt, [use the Nuxt nightly channel](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/nightly-release-channel#opting-in) as it already includes `nitropack-nightly`.
::

Remove the lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `bun.lockb`) and reinstall the dependencies.
