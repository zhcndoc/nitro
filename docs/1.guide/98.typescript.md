# TypeScript

> Nitro automatically generates the types for auto-imports and server routes :sparkles:

## `tsconfig.json`

To leverage type hints within your project, create a `tsconfig.json` file that extends auto generated types.

::code-group
```json [tsconfig.json (nitro)]
{
  "extends": "./.nitro/types/tsconfig.json"
}
```

```json [server/tsconfig.json (nuxt)]
{
  "extends": "../.nuxt/tsconfig.server.json"
}
```
::

::tip
Starter templates have this file by default and usually you don't need to do anything. If this file does not exists, you can manually create it.
::

## Prepare types

You can use `prepare` command to auto generate the types.
This can be useful in a CI environment or as a `postinstall` command in your `package.json`.

:pm-x{command="nitro prepare"}

::tip
When using `nitro dev` command, types are also auto generated!
::

::note
For [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) you should use `nuxi generate`
